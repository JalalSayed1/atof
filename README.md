# atof
Convert string s to its double precision equivalent. Section 4.2 of The C Programming Language.

## About the project:
- `atof` converts string to its equivalent **double** precision value.
- `atoi_using_atof` converts string to its equivalent **int** value (uses atof).
- `atof_with_scientific_notations` extended version of atof to support scientific notations such as 123.45e-6.

## What did I learn from it:
- Using math.h library in C.
- Calling external programs in the same directory.
- Further understanding of floating-point numbers and functions in C.
